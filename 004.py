#A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
#Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

#Extra from HackerRank: Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers which is less than N.
#I extended this further to allow a digits parameter, d
